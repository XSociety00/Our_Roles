# My Role as the team's System Architecture - Napo Qheku
As the System Architect, my primary responsibility is to ensure the overall design, structure, and coherence of the system are well-planned and aligned with the project objectives.
### 1. Ensure Clear Communication and Collaboration
- Coordinate with the Team Leader: Maintain open communication with the Team Leader to ensure progress aligns with the overall project goals and timeline.
- Foster Collaboration Between Roles: Facilitate communication between team members, especially the Analyst, Designer, and Programmer, to ensure that the ISA design, architecture, and code implementation are in sync.
- Clarify Dependencies: Make sure the Researcher, Programmer, and Quality Assurance work together to gather relevant information, implement the processor design, and test it comprehensively.

2. Define and Maintain System Architecture
- Architecture Consistency: Oversee the ISA and microarchitecture design to ensure that the processor structure is efficient, low-cost, and aligned with the domain requirements (e.g., energy-efficient, optimized for communication devices).
- Component Integration: Make sure the design of core components such as the ALU, control unit, and memory modules is well-integrated. Collaborate with the Designer to develop a clear microarchitecture diagram.
- Modular Design: Ensure the system is designed in a modular way, so it can be tested and debugged in smaller pieces, making development and quality control easier.

3. Review and Guide the Instruction Set Architecture (ISA)
- Collaborate with the Programmer and Analyst to make sure the ISA is simple but versatile enough for the intended communication and transaction tasks. Verify that the instructions support low-power and efficient operations.
- Ensure that the ISA supports all the operations needed by the sample assembly program that will be developed.

4. Technical Oversight During Development
- Programmer Collaboration: Work closely with the Programmer to make sure the code is aligned with the architecture. Review the simulator’s codebase and check whether it matches the microarchitecture design.
- UI/UX Oversight: As the UI/UX Specialist, ensure the graphical user interface is simple, intuitive, and accurately displays important processor states such as register contents, memory values, and the current instruction.

5. Support the Researcher and Quality Assurance
- Guide the Researcher: Provide direction on what information is crucial for the processor design (e.g., low-power optimization techniques, handling of communication protocols in embedded systems).
- Ensure Quality Testing: Collaborate with the Quality Assurance member to develop comprehensive test cases and validate the system’s performance. Ensure that the processor executes the designed assembly program correctly and efficiently.

6. Documentation Review
- Documentation Specialist: Work with the Documentation Specialist to ensure that the architectural decisions, ISA, and microarchitecture are clearly documented. This is crucial for future reference and team coordination.
- Review the system architecture, ISA, and microarchitecture descriptions for clarity, ensuring they are aligned with the design and implementation phases.

7. Regular Progress Checks
- Attend Weekly Progress Meetings to ensure that each team member is on track with their responsibilities and that any roadblocks are identified early.
- Use version control (Git) to review contributions and ensure each component is integrated seamlessly.

8. Adopt Agile Principles
- As a team member, ensure iterative development by working in short, manageable sprints. Provide regular feedback to the team to improve each iteration.
- Keep track of deliverables and ensure they are submitted on time for review and adjustment.
